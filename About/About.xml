A few minor tweaks to the UI when selecting groups:
  -shows weapon range when the mouse is over the "Attack" button
  -shows the weapon types that are equipped 
   -- clicking the weapon allows for assigning targets to all pawns with that weapon
All of the code is basically vanilla Rimworld, I just linked various bits up. Hopefully this or something along these lines will be incorporated into [1.0]
&lt;size=24&gt;Powered by Harmony&lt;/size&gt;
